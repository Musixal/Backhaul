## Usage

The main executable for this project is `backhaul`. It requires a TOML configuration file for both the server and client components.

### Configuration Options

To start using the solution, you'll need to configure both server and client components. Here’s how to set up basic configurations:

* **Server Configuration**

   Create a configuration file named `config.toml`:

    ```toml
    [server]# Local, IRAN
    bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"    # Address and port for the server to listen on (mandatory).
    transport = "tcp"             # Protocol to use ("tcp", "tcpmux", "ws", "wss", "wsmux", "wssmux". mandatory).
    accept_udp = false             # Enable transferring UDP connections over TCP transport. (optional, default: false)
    token = "your_token"          # Authentication token for secure communication (optional).
    keepalive_period = 75         # Interval in seconds to send keep-alive packets.(optional, default: 75s)
    nodelay = false               # Enable TCP_NODELAY (optional, default: false).
    channel_size = 2048           # Tunnel and Local channel size. Excess connections are discarded. (optional, default: 2048).
    heartbeat = 40                # In seconds. Ping interval for tunnel stability. Min: 1s. (Optional, default: 40s)
    mux_con = 8                   # Mux concurrency. Number of connections that can be multiplexed into a single stream (optional, default: 8).
    mux_version = 1               # SMUX protocol version (1 or 2). Version 2 may have extra features. (optional)
    mux_framesize = 32768         # 32 KB. The maximum size of a frame that can be sent over a connection. (optional)
    mux_recievebuffer = 4194304   # 4 MB. The maximum buffer size for incoming data per connection. (optional)
    mux_streambuffer = 65536      # 256 KB. The maximum buffer size per individual stream within a connection. (optional)

    sniffer_log ="/root/log.json" # Filename used to store network traffic and usage data logs. (optional, default backhaul.json)
    tls_cert = "/root/server.crt" # Path to the TLS certificate file for wss/wssmux. (mandatory).
    tls_key = "/root/server.key"  # Path to the TLS private key file for wss/wssmux. (mandatory).
    log_level = "info"            # Log level ("panic", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace", optional, default: "info").
    skip_optz = true              # Skip optimizations performed by Backhaul (default: false)
    mss = 1360                    # TCP/TCPMux: Maximum Segment Size in bytes; controls max TCP payload size to avoid fragmentation. (default: system-defined)
    so_rcvbuf = 4194304           # TCP/TCPMux: Socket receive buffer size (bytes); larger buffer allows higher throughput on receive side. (default: system-defined)
    so_sndbuf = 1048576           # TCP/TCPMux: Socket send buffer size (bytes); controls send queue size to manage outgoing data flow. (default: system-defined)
  
    metrics = ["default", "prometheus"] # metrics exposed via web_port. only the legacy json ("default") and prometheus ("prometheus") are supported. to achieve backward compatibility without changing the config file, legacy json is enabled by default.

    ports = [
    "443-600",                  # Listen on all ports in the range 443 to 600
    "443-600:5201",             # Listen on all ports in the range 443 to 600 and forward traffic to 5201
    "443-600=1.1.1.1:5201",     # Listen on all ports in the range 443 to 600 and forward traffic to 1.1.1.1:5201
    "443",                      # Listen on local port 443 and forward to remote port 443 (default forwarding).
    "4000=5000",                # Listen on local port 4000 (bind to all local IPs) and forward to remote port 5000.
    "127.0.0.2:443=5201",       # Bind to specific local IP (127.0.0.2), listen on port 443, and forward to remote port 5201.
    "443=1.1.1.1:5201",         # Listen on local port 443 and forward to a specific remote IP (1.1.1.1) on port 5201.
    "127.0.0.2:443=1.1.1.1:5201",  # Bind to specific local IP (127.0.0.2), listen on port 443, and forward to remote IP (1.1.1.1) on port 5201.
   ]

    ```

   To start the `server`:

   ```sh
   ./backhaul -c config.toml
   ```

## Generating a Self-Signed TLS Certificate with OpenSSL

To generate a TLS certificate and key, you can use tools like OpenSSL. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create a self-signed certificate and key using OpenSSL:

### Step 1: Install OpenSSL

If you don't already have OpenSSL installed, you can install it using your system's package manager.

- **On Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install openssl
  ```
### Step 2: Generate a Private Key
To generate a 2048-bit RSA private key, run the following command:
  ```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
  ```
This will create a file named `server.key`, which is your private key.
### Step 3: Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using the private key. This CSR is used to generate the SSL certificate:
  ```bash
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
  ```

You will be prompted to enter information for the CSR. For the common name (CN), use the domain name or IP address where your server will be hosted. Example:
```
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:San Francisco
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Your Company Name
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:example.com
Email Address []:
```

### Step 4: Generate a Self-Signed Certificate

Use the CSR and private key to generate a self-signed certificate. Specify the validity period (in days):
  ```bash
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt -days 365
  ```
This will generate a certificate named `server.crt`, valid for 365 days.
### Recap of the Files Generated:

* `server.key`: Your private key.
* `server.csr`: The certificate signing request (used to generate the certificate).
* `server.crt`: Your self-signed TLS certificate.

## Running backhaul as a service

To create a service file for your backhaul project that ensures the service restarts automatically, you can use the following template for a systemd service file. Assuming your project runs a reverse tunnel and the main executable file is located in a certain path, here's a basic example:

1. Create the service file `/etc/systemd/system/backhaul.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Backhaul Reverse Tunnel Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/root/backhaul -c /root/config.toml
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=1048576

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
2. After creating the service file, enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable backhaul.service
sudo systemctl start backhaul.service
```
3. To verify if the service is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status backhaul.service
```
4. View the most recent log entries for the backhaul.service unit:
```bash
journalctl -u backhaul.service -e -f
```

## Monitoring

setting `web_port` to a non-zero value will enable the monitoring interface.

you can choose which monitoring interface you want to use by setting `metrics` to `prometheus`, `default` or both. empty array will fallback to `["default"]`

### Basic Monitoring Setup
you can set up a basic monitoring setup using prometheus and grafana.
![grafana dashboard](monitoring/dashboard.jpg)

(while not necessary, it is recommended to use docker)
1. install docker, docker-compose
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose-v2
    # to run docker without sudo
    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    # If you're running Linux in a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.
   ```
2. create a `docker-compose.yml` like [this example](monitoring/docker-compose.yml)
3. create a prometheus.yaml like [this example](monitoring/prometheus.yml)
4. run the docker-compose file
    ```bash
      docker compose up -d
    ```
5. visit grafana dashboard at `http://SERVER_IP:3000` (default username/password is `admin`)
6. create a new datasource, choose prometheus, and enter the url `http://prometheus:9090`
7. via `Dashboards > New > import` import the [example dashboard](monitoring/dashboard.jpg) or [create your own](https://grafana.com/tutorials/)

## FAQ

**Q: How do I decide which transport protocol to use?**

* `tcp`: Use if you need straightforward TCP connections.
* `tcpmux`: Use if you need to handle multiple sessions over a single connection.
* `ws`: Use if you need to traverse HTTP-based firewalls or proxies.
