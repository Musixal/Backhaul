## Introduction

This project offers a robust reverse tunneling solution to overcome NAT and firewall restrictions, supporting various transport protocols. It’s engineered for high efficiency and concurrency.

## Installation

1. **Download** the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/musixal/backhaul/releases).
2. **Extract** the archive (adjust the `filename` if needed):  

   ```bash
   tar -xzf backhaul_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ``` 
3. **Run** the executable:  

   ```bash
   ./backhaul
   ```
4. You can also build from source if preferred:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/musixal/backhaul.git
   cd backhaul
   go build
   ./backhaul
   ```

## Usage

The main executable for this project is `backhaul`. It requires a TOML configuration file for both the server and client components.

### Configuration Options

To start using the solution, you'll need to configure both server and client components. Here’s how to set up basic configurations:

* **Server Configuration**

   Create a configuration file named `config.toml`:

    ```toml
    [server]# Local, IRAN
    bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080" # Address and port for the server to listen (mandatory).
    transport = "tcp"          # Protocol ("tcp", "tcpmux", or "ws", optional, default: "tcp").
    token = "your_token"       # Authentication token (optional).
    keepalive_period = 20      # Specify keep-alive period in seconds. (optional, default: 20 seconds)
    nodelay = false            # Enable TCP_NODELAY (optional, default: false).
    channel_size = 2048        # Tunnel channel size. Excess connections are discarded. Only for tcp and ws mode (optional, default: 2048).
    connection_pool = 8        # Number of pre-established connections. Only for tcp and ws mode (optional, default: 8).
    mux_session = 1            # Number of mux sessions for tcpmux. (optional, default: 1).
    log_level = "info"         # Log level ("panic", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace", optional, default: "info").

    ports = [ # Local to remote port mapping in this format LocalPort=RemotePort (mandatory).
        "4000=5201",
        "4001=5201",
        "4003", # Local and remote port are the same.
        "[4004:4006]", # port range. it's equal to "4004=4004", "4005=4005", "4006=4006"
        "[4007:4009]=5201", # port range. it's equal to "4007=5201", "4008=5201", "4009=5201"
    ]
    ```

   To start the `server`:

   ```sh
   ./backhaul -c config.toml
   ```
* **Client Configuration**

   Create a configuration file named `config.toml` for the client:
   ```toml
   [client]  # Behind NAT, firewall-blocked
   remote_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080" # Server address and port (mandatory).
   transport = "tcp"            # Protocol ("tcp", "tcpmux", or "ws", optional, default: "tcp").
   token = "your_token"         # Authentication token (optional).
   keepalive_period = 20        # Specify keep-alive period in seconds. (optional, default: 20 seconds)
   nodelay = false              # Use TCP_NODELAY (optional, default: false).
   retry_interval = 1           # Retry interval in seconds (optional, default: 1).
   log_level = "info"           # Log level ("panic", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace", optional, default: "info").
   mux_session = 1              # Number of mux sessions for tcpmux. (optional, default: 1).

   forwarder = [ # Forward incoming connection to another address. optional.
      "4000=IP:PORT",
      "4001=127.0.0.1:9090",
   ]
   ```

   To start the `client`:

   ```sh
   ./backhaul -c config.toml
   ```

### Detailed Configuration
#### Transport Protocols

You can configure the `server` and `client` to use different transport protocols based on your requirements:

   * **TCP (`tcp`)**: Basic TCP transport, suitable for most scenarios.
   * **TCP Multiplexing (`tcpmux`)**: Provides multiplexing capabilities to handle multiple sessions over a single connection.
   * **WebSocket (`ws`)**: Ideal for traversing HTTP-based firewalls and proxies.

#### TCP Configuration
* **Server**:

   ```toml
   [server]
   bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"
   transport = "tcp"
   token = "your_token" 
   channel_size = 2048
   connection_pool = 8
   nodelay = true 
   ports = []
   ```
* **Client**:

   ```toml
   [client]
   remote_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"
   transport = "tcp"
   token = "your_token" 
   nodelay = true 
   ```
* **Details**:

   `remote_addr`: The IPv4, IPv6, or domain address of the server to which the client connects.

   `token`: An authentication token used to securely validate and authenticate the connection between the client and server within the tunnel.

   `channel_size`: The queue size for forwarding packets from server to the client. If the limit is exceeded, packets will be dropped.

   `connection_pool`: Set the number of pre-established connections for better latency.
   
   `nodelay`: Refers to a TCP socket option (TCP_NODELAY) that improve the latency but decrease the bandwidth

#### TCP Multiplexing Configuration
* **Server**:

   ```toml
   [server]
   bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"
   transport = "tcpmux"
   token = "your_token" 
   mux_session = 1
   nodelay = true 
   ports = []
   ```
* **Client**:

   ```toml
   [client]
   remote_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"
   transport = "tcpmux"
   token = "your_token" 
   mux_session = 1
   nodelay = true 
   ```
* **Details**:

   `mux_session`: Number of multiplexed sessions. Increase this if you need to handle more simultaneous sessions over a single connection.
   
   * Refer to TCP configuration for more information.


#### WebSocket Configuration
* **Server**:

   ```toml
   [server]
   bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"
   transport = "ws"
   token = "your_token" 
   channel_size = 2048
   connection_pool = 8
   nodelay = true 
   ports = []
   ```

* **Client**:

   ```toml
   [client]
   remote_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"
   transport = "ws"
   token = "your_token" 
   nodelay = true 
   ```

* **Details**:

   * Refer to TCP configuration for more information.


## Running backhaul as a service

To create a service file for your backhaul project that ensures the service restarts automatically, you can use the following template for a systemd service file. Assuming your project runs a reverse tunnel and the main executable file is located in a certain path, here's a basic example:

1. Create the service file `/etc/systemd/system/backhaul.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Backhaul Reverse Tunnel Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/root/backhaul -c /root/config.toml
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=1048576

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
2. After creating the service file, enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable backhaul.service
sudo systemctl start backhaul.service
```
3. To verify if the service is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status backhaul.service
```
4. View the most recent log entries for the backhaul.service unit:
```bash
journalctl -u backhaul.service -e -f
```

## FAQ

**Q: How do I decide which transport protocol to use?**

* `tcp`: Use if you need straightforward TCP connections.
* `tcpmux`: Use if you need to handle multiple sessions over a single connection.
* `ws`: Use if you need to traverse HTTP-based firewalls or proxies.
